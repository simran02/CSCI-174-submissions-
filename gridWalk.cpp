/*
 There is a monkey which can walk around on a planar grid. The monkey
 can move one space at a time left, right, up or down. That is, from
 (x, y) the monkey can go to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1).
 Points where the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the x
 coordinate plus the sum of the digits of the absolute value of the y
 coordinate are lesser than or equal to 19 are accessible to the monkey.
 For example, the point (59, 79) is inaccessible because 5 + 9 + 7 + 9 = 30,
 which is greater than 19. Another example: the point (-5, -7) is
 accessible because abs(-5) + abs(-7) = 5 + 7 = 12, which is less than 19.
 How many points can the monkey access if it starts at (0, 0), including
 (0, 0) itself?
